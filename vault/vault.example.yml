# Ansible Vault - Example variable template (DO NOT put real secrets here)
# Copy this file to group_vars/<group>/vault.yml or host_vars/<host>/vault.yml,
# fill in your values, then encrypt: ansible-vault create group_vars/<group>/vault.yml
#
# The encrypted file will be ignored by git (.gitignore: group_vars/*/vault, *.vault).
#
# To encrypt the SSH password: (1) Put it here and encrypt the whole file with
# ansible-vault create/edit; or (2) Use ansible-vault encrypt_string 'password' --name ansible_password
# and paste the !vault | block here. See docs/VAULT.md "Encrypting the SSH password".

# SSH / network device credentials (used by playbooks that need device access)
ansible_user: "your_username"
ansible_password: "your_ssh_password"
ansible_become: yes
ansible_become_method: enable
ansible_become_password: "your_enable_password"

# Optional: API keys or other secrets
# api_key: "your_api_key"
